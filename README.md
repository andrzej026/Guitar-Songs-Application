# Guitar-Songs-Application
First implementation of an app with a server, database, registration and authorization.

The application is thematic and is designed to search and add information about lyrics with guitar chords.

It was originally implemented as a graduation project for a bootcamp in October 2021. But despite the successful protection, due to some weak parts of the project, it has been rewritten since April 2022.
